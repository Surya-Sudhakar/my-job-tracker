üìä Multi-User Job Application Tracker
This is a robust and persistent job application tracker built with React, designed to help individuals efficiently manage their job search. It supports multiple users, with each user's data securely stored and accessible only by them, thanks to Firebase's powerful backend services.

‚ú® Features
Secure User Authentication: Users can register and log in with their email and password, ensuring personalized and private job tracking.

Persistent Data Storage: All job applications are stored securely in Firebase Firestore, meaning your data is safe and accessible across different devices and sessions.

Real-time Updates: Changes to job applications are instantly reflected, keeping your tracker always up-to-date.

Full CRUD Operations: Easily Create, Read, Update, and Delete job application entries.

Application Status Tracking: Categorize applications by status (e.g., Applied, Interview, Offer, Rejected, Accepted, Wishlist).

Notes & Date Tracking: Add detailed notes and track the date each application was submitted.

Responsive User Interface: Built with Tailwind CSS for a modern, clean, and mobile-friendly design.

Free Hosting & Backend: Leverages Firebase's generous free tier for both hosting and database services, keeping your personal tracking costs at zero for typical usage.

üöÄ Getting Started
Follow these steps to get your own multi-user job application tracker up and running locally, and then deployed to GitHub Pages.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have:

Node.js (LTS version recommended) and npm (or Yarn) installed on your machine.

A GitHub account to host your frontend application.

A Google account to set up your Firebase project (for authentication and database).

Step 1: Local Project Setup
Create Your Project Folder:
Create a new, empty directory on your computer (e.g., my-job-tracker).

Navigate into the Folder:
Open your terminal or command prompt and move into this new directory:

cd my-job-tracker

Create Subfolders:
Inside my-job-tracker, create the public and src subfolders.

Create Files & Copy Content:
Create the following files in their respective locations and copy the code from the Canvas immersives provided to you in our conversation:

package.json (in the root directory)

tailwind.config.js (in the root directory)

public/index.html

src/App.js (this is the main application logic)

src/index.js

src/index.css

.gitignore (in the root directory)

README.md (this file!)

‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL package.json Update:
Open your package.json file and update the homepage field to reflect your GitHub username and repository name.

{
  // ...
  "homepage": "http://YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME.github.io/YOUR_REPO_NAME",
  // Example: "homepage": "http://surya-sudhakar.github.io/my-job-tracker",
  // ...
}

Replace YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username and YOUR_REPO_NAME with the exact name of your GitHub repository.

‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL src/App.js Update:
Open src/App.js and paste your unique Firebase configuration object into the firebaseConfig constant, replacing the placeholder values.

Install Dependencies:
In your project's root directory, run:

npm install
# or yarn install

Step 2: Firebase Project Configuration
This enables user authentication and data storage.

Create a Firebase Project:

Go to the Firebase Console.

Click "Add project" and follow the prompts to create a new project.

Add a Web App & Get Config:

From your Firebase project's overview page, click the Web icon (</>) to add a new web app.

Register your app and copy the firebaseConfig object it provides. This is what you'll paste into src/App.js.

Enable Email/Password Authentication:

In the Firebase Console, go to "Build" -> "Authentication".

Navigate to the "Sign-in method" tab.

Find "Email/Password", click on it, enable it, and save.

Set Up Firestore Database & Rules:

In the Firebase Console, go to "Build" -> "Firestore Database".

Click "Create database".

Choose "Start in production mode" (recommended for security) and select a region.

Go to the "Rules" tab for your Firestore database.

Publish the following security rules. These rules ensure that each user can only read and write their own job applications:

rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Allow authenticated users to read/write their own job applications
    match /artifacts/{appId}/users/{userId}/jobApplications/{docId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
  }
}

Step 3: Deploy to GitHub Pages
Build Your React Application:
This command creates the optimized static files for deployment. You MUST run this every time you update your code before deploying.

npm run build

Verify that a build folder is created in your project root with index.html and other assets.

Initialize Git & Push to GitHub:

Initialize Git in your project folder:

git init

Add all files and commit:

git add .
git commit -m "Initial project setup and Firebase integration"

Create a new public repository on GitHub with the exact same name as your project folder (e.g., my-job-tracker).

Link your local repository to the remote one and push your code. GitHub will provide the exact commands, similar to:

git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

Deploy to GitHub Pages:
Once your build folder is ready and your code is on GitHub, deploy it using the gh-pages script:

npm run deploy

Enable GitHub Pages in Your Repository Settings:

Go to your GitHub repository on the web (e.g., https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME).

Click on the "Settings" tab.

In the left sidebar, click on "Pages".

Under "Branch," select the gh-pages branch and click "Save".

Your multi-user job tracker will soon be live at the homepage URL you configured in your package.json! It might take a few minutes for GitHub Pages to fully update and display your site.
